The spreadsheet permission are set to public (read-only) spreadsheet so that YQL can access it.

Enable "Publish to web" for the spreadsheet using CSV format. 

Create separate sheets for each quiz. You can also use a sheet to list and link to available quizzes.

YQL is used to query and parse the Google docs spreadsheet CSV to JSON used by jQwiz.
